# Introduction to refactoring non-reactive code

## Separate reactive and non-reactive logic

- Most Shiny app code is non-reactive
    - Drawing plots
    - Summarizing data
    - Interacting with databases
    - (Really, everything except the actual reading of reactive inputs and calcs)
- It's fine to include this code inside reactive functions
- As your app grows you should separate them

## Reactivity makes everything harder

- Reactive context makes them inherently more difficult
    - Harder to debug
    - Harder to test
    - Harder to document
    - Harder to reason about

## Pull logic out of the reactive context

Non-reactive functions are familiar and predictable

You can:

- call them in a notebook
- write unit tests 
- reuse them in other contexts

In turn, this makes your reactive code much clearer
