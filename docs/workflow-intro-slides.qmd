# Goals

## Goals

Learn some Shiny best practices:

- How and when to refactor your app
- Understand `shiny` modules
- Iterate over lists to generate UI
- Understand scoping rules
- Deploy your app to the cloud
    - For example, to <https://connect.posit.cloud/>

# Refactoring

## Introduction to refactoring

From [wikipedia](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring):

> In computer programming and software design, **code refactoring** is the process of restructuring existing source code - changing the factoring  - without changing its external behavior.

For example:

- Convert repeating scripts to a function
- Split a long function into smaller functions
- Separating code into python modules or `shiny` modules

## Refactoring a shiny app

When should you refactor?

- You're trying to hold too much in your head
- Changing the app is difficult
- Other people don't understand your code
- You don't understand your code!

Avoid premature refactoring

- Start by just getting your app to work
- Take small steps to avoid repetition
- Ultimately you're the one who needs to work with the code



## Three main techniques

1. Separate reactive and non-reactive code
1. Use `shiny` modules
1. Use functions to generate UI
