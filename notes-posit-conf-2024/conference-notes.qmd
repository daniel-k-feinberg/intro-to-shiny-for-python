# Intro to Shiny

## Basic components

1.  Inputs
2.  Outputs
3.  Instructions for how to build outputs from inputs

*Note: you can use some outputs as inputs and and some inputs as outputs*

## What we don't need to worry about

-   cache

-   state

-   callbacks

-   or even HTML, CSS, or JavaScript

## `Shiny Express` vs `Shiny Core`

-   two different syntaxes for writing shiny apps

-   we will learn `shinyexpress` today

    -   lighter weight

    -   designed around notebooks

    -   apps are faster with less boilerplate

-   You may never need `shiny core`

-   decorators in python allow us to reduce the number of lines of code to do the same thing

    -   `shiny express` uses decorators in a more extensive way; very powerful; less boilerplate

# Discussing Outputs

-   decorators help a lot

-   what is a decorator

    -   a function that wraps another function

    -   returns a modified version of the function being called

    -   allows our code to be much more concise
