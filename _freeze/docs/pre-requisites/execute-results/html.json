We will only be able to give minimal support for this option during the workshop.\n\nYou can use [Positron](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron) instead of VS Code if you feel adventurous.\n:::\n\nWhile Shinylive is great, it likely isn't the environment you'll use to develop Shiny apps, and so it makes sense to set up VS Code and run the examples locally. To do this follow these steps before the workshop:\n\n1.  Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\n\n1.  Install the Shiny for Python [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=posit.shiny-python)\n\n1.  Clone the repository using:\n\n    ``` sh\n    git clone https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-python-workshop-2023.git\n    ```\n    \n    or alternately download the repository as a zip file: \n\n    ![](../images/git-download-button.png){width=\"287\"}\n\n1.  Navigate to the project directory and create a new virtual environment using\n\n    ```{.python}\n    python3 -m venv .venv\n    ```\n\n1.  Set your python interpreter to the virtual environment with {{< kbd CMD+SHIFT+P >}} and then typing `Select Interpreter`\n\n1.  Open a new terminal prompt, which should switch to `(.venv)`\n\n    Or ensure the virtual environment is activated by running:\n\n    ``` sh\n    source .venv/bin/activate\n    ```\n\n1.  Install the relevant packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n\nAll of the example apps and problems are stored in the `/docs/exercises` directory. \n\nIf you've installed the Shiny for Python VS Code extension, you can run any of the apps by opening the `app.py` file and clicking the play button in the top right.\n\nAlternatively, run a shiny app from the command line using:\n\n```{.python}\nshiny run <path-to-app.py> --reload\n```\n\n",
