We will only be able to give minimal support for this option during the workshop.\n\nYou can use [Positron](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron) instead of VS Code if you feel adventurous.\n:::\n\nWhile Shinylive is great, it likely isn't the environment you'll use to develop Shiny apps, and so it makes sense to set up VS Code and run the examples locally.

Navigate to the project directory and create a new virtual environment using\n\n    ```{.python}\n    python3 -m venv .venv\n    ```\n\n1.  Set your python interpreter to the virtual environment with {{< kbd CMD+SHIFT+P >}} and then typing `Select Interpreter`\n\n1.  Open a new terminal prompt, which should switch to `(.venv)`\n\n    Or ensure the virtual environment is activated by running:\n\n    ``` sh\n    source .venv/bin/activate\n    ```\n\n1.
